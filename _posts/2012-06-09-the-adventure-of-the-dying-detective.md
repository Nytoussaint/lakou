The art exhibition “Colors of the Soul” opened last Friday at the City Art Gallery. It features over 40 paintings and sculptures by local and international artists. The main theme of the exhibition is emotion — how feelings like joy, sadness, anger, and love can be expressed through color, form, and texture.

One of the most impressive works is a large abstract painting by Haitian artist Marie-Lyne Désir, which uses bright reds and deep blues to explore the complexity of identity. Another highlight is a series of black-and-white portraits showing the daily lives of people in rural communities.

The exhibition aims to connect visitors with the artists’ inner worlds and encourage them to reflect on their own emotions. It will be open to the public until July 15, with guided tours every Saturday.
