The initiative embodies ethical principles by fostering inclusivity and respect for diverse identities and perspectives. Through its operational guidelines, it ensures that submissions and captions are accepted in all languages, promoting accessibility and amplifying underrepresented voices. By centering Black spiritualities and plight, the initiative actively combats spiritists' invisibilized labor and communities' structural inequalities. Curating submissions with the contributor's consent and encouraging cross-posting empowers participants while respecting their autonomy and agency over their creative output.

The project maintains a staunch commitment to intersectionality, refusing submissions that perpetuate harm towards marginalized groups based on factors such as gender identity, sexual orientation, class, ability, faith, citizenship, language. This approach promotes equity and prevents the perpetuation of injustices.

Furthermore, the initiative consciously seeks to elevate spiritual and artistic traditions historically marginalized or underrepresented, fostering cultural appreciation and recognition. Submissions are encouraged from Haitian Vodou, Lucumi, Kongo, African Hebraic Traditions, Black Pentecostalism, Rastafari, Obeah, Hoodoo, Gwoka, Bomba, Gaga, Palo, Carolina Hymn and the like.
